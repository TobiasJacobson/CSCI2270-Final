# CSCI2270-Final
Tobias Jacobson, Nate Christy, and James Burke final project for CSCI 2270 Spring 2019

Bandersnatch
------------

This is a text-based horror game in which you will start at a fixed point and be able to get multiple
endings, most of which result in death, and experience well-written storylines. Enjoy

It was created in C++ 11 using a few different files including a story text file with all of the
written storyline, a game file containing all of the backend controls, a driver file for each
instance of the game and all of the UI. There is also a .png with the storyboard/flowchart we
used to plan the story and code. The basis for the project is traversing the story through nodes
of a large graph data structure due to its ease of non-linear/binary traverse.
